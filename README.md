# React Application


## Installation

Run the following instruccion on CLI:

```sh
npm install
```

And it's just as easy with [npm](http://npmjs.com):

```sh
npm i --save react
```

## Contribute

The main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use. If you're interested in helping with that, then keep reading. If you're not interested in helping right now that's ok too. :) Any feedback you have about using React would be greatly appreciated.

### Building Your Copy of React

The process to build `react.js` is built entirely on top of node.js, using many libraries you may already be familiar with.

#### Prerequisites

* You have `node` installed at v6.0.0+ and `npm` at v3.0.0+.
* You have `gcc` installed or are comfortable installing a compiler if needed. Some of our `npm` dependencies may require a compliation step. On OS X, the Xcode Command Line Tools will cover this. On Ubuntu, `apt-get install build-essential` will install the required packages. Similar commands should work on other Linux distros. Windows will require some additional steps, see the [`node-gyp` installation instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for details.
* You are familiar with `npm` and know whether or not you need to use `sudo` when installing packages globally.
* You are familiar with `git`.

#### Build

Once you have the repository cloned, building a copy of `react.js` is really easy.

```sh
# npm must have been installed already
nmp start
```

At this point, you should see an express server listening at port 4000.
