# React Application


## Installation

Run the following instruccion on CLI in order to install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

And it's just as easy with [npm](http://npmjs.com):

```sh
npm i --save react
```
#### Prerequisites

* You have `node` installed at v6.0.0+ and `npm` at v3.0.0+.
* You should have been familiar with `git` and `npm`.

#### Build

Once you have the repository cloned, building for building this app you need run the command.

```sh
# npm must have been installed already
npm start
```

At this point, you should see an express server listening at port 4000.
